# Clients-classification
Predicting wether a customer is going to be loyal client or going to leave the bank:
This project is a direct application for most common and simple Artificial Intelligence models such as Logistic regression,KNN,SVC .We used a dataset from kaggle and explored it to see if there is any problems like umbalanced data or missing values or unnecessary columns.After that we visualized the data to see which attributes are the most correlated to our target after that we devided our data into training and testing data and finally we used these models to predict wether a costumer is excited or not and see which model have the best accuracy,precision and recall.

Key words : python / sklearn / LogisticRegression / KNeighborsClassifier / SVC / Decision Trees / Random Forests / MLPClassifier / ANN
